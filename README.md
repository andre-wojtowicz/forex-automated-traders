# Forex automated traders

This project consists of two algorithms for automated trading on Forex. The algorithms are written in MQL4 and can be used on MetaTrader platform.

### Algorithms

1. **Gap Closure** - this algorithm takes advantage of weekly Friday-Monday trading breaks on markets; when the difference between Friday closing and Monday opening is big enough, then this strategy makes profit.
1. **Simple Expert Advisor** - it implements the expert advisor which is desribed in Andrew R. Young's book *Expert Advisor Programming: Creating Automated Trading Systems in MQL for MetaTrader 4*; some aspects of the original algorithm are extended and fixed so that the auto-trader is usable; however, this strategy does not make profit.
